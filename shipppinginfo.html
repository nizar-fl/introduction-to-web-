            <p class="minp2"> The transit time table above is ONLY a reference for you to estimate the delivery date. We do not guarantee to deliver your order on or before a certain date, nor can we issue a refund due to a delay with the shipment. Also, these transit times do not include Customs clearance processing times, and the updates for the parcels’ status can take time after departure from Korea because of the processing time at Customs of the destination country.

              <br>

              Unfortunately, please note that we cannot be responsible for any delays caused by Customs clearance processes, and local duties and taxes.
              
               
              <br><br><br><br>
              The customs office of the destination country may impose customs fees, import duties, taxes, and other charges to your international order where applicable. International customers will be responsible for any fees, duties, taxes or any surcharges levied or charged by their country. As customs policies vary widely from case to case for each country, please check with local authorities prior to placing your order to confirm taxes and duties.
              
               
              <br><br><br><br>
              Please understand that it is customer’s responsibility to check the shipping status on the tracking page and to contact the local courier directly in case there are any issues for receiving the items in your country, after the parcel departed from Korea. WINGBLING does not take any responsibility for the delivery failure due to miscommunication, and any dispute raised after 14 business days has passed from the last shipping status update is not accepted.
